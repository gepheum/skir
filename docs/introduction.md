## Why Skir

*   Generates code in different languages. This makes Skir ideal for systems where different services are written in different languages but need to exchange structured data.
*   Supports serialization to JSON or binary format.
*   Serialize now, deserialize in 100 years. Skir is designed with backward and forward compatibility in mind. You can evolve your data schemas by adding new fields or renaming fields. You will still be able to deserialize old values, and you won't break existing applications that use older versions of the schema.
*   Generates code that makes no compromise with type safety.
*   Allows you to define typesafe interfaces between your services or your backend and your frontend.
*   No boilerplate code when you adding a new method to a service.
